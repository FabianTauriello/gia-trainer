NOTES:

- follow the 60-30-10 rule for using color palette. 60% of the view should be a dominant color, 30% should be the secondary color or texture and the last 10% should be an accent

TODOs:

- [ ] rename pages folder to routes?
- [ ] change data.json to hold questions only, and just render description, title etc as regular html?
- [ ] get it working with section 1 first
- [ ] add a warning modal/dialog when exiting a quiz (e.g. pressing the back button)
- [ ] add preferences/settings section for toggling things like timer visibility and theme
- [ ] add context around quiz component to minimise prop drilling and establish contextual quiz state or MAKE IT MORE COMPOSABLE!?
- [ ] create a custom hook for incrementing question index?
- [ ] separate sections into completely different components so that I can just use static text for the description/intro to each section
- [ ] don't forget about generics!
